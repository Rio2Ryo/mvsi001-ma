After discovering Mother Vegetables, about three weeks in my skin looked noticeably different. The cheek spots that bothered me were softly blurred and even seemed to fade. The darkness and dullness around my eyes eased, and my overall tone became brighter and more even. It’s easy to use on mature skin."

My texture feels smoother and the finish looks natural—like my bare skin itself became prettier. My morning makeup lasts much longer and I touch up far less. It delivers makeup and skincare at once, so it’s now a daily essential."

After a while, the dark spots and bruises gradually looked lighter and my tone seemed more even. The roughness on my arms feels smoother too. If you care for your skin properly, it really responds—no matter your age."
